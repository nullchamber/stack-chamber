# Stack Chamber Blog Development

### Alpha Phase
Once I've set up a project directory, I first spawn a Virtual Environment and install the necessary libraries.
Usually it's going to be Django (4.1.7 and up), Pillow for serving static images, and the "faker" library, which 
makes generating quality test data easy and useful.'

### Alpha Phase Build Steps

+ Initialize the "blog" app
+ Install the app into the Project's site via the settings.py file
